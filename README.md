# Learning OCaml
I want to learn a functional language, and OCaml is as good as any. I will probably pick up Haskell later, and I've read a bit about $\lambda$ calculus already (favorite concept in CS I've learnt so far).

I'm starting out by looking at these two books [OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html#) and [Real World OCaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/index.html). I might just implement random projects that I'm familiar with in other langauges to get used to OCaml syntax but we will see. I do know that I won't be able to spend much time learning OCaml till next term, but I want to make a repo initially so I force myself to learn every so often when I have the time this term.
